#Self-Learning Project#

Humans have alot of free time and I believe what differs the greats from the norms is the fact when norms sleep greats spend their time growing. A quote that I believe in: It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop. I am real interested in speed-learning and I am not sure how I am going to learn best but this is where the magic happens. I am creating this repository as a means to push projects that I have done as assignments. These projects are based off given assignments. I have a theory that I learn best by doing so do many. I am not sure what I will be pushing here but I do have regulations for pushing into this directory.

##self-regulations

* Push once per day for at least six months. Starting July 1st.
* Organize learning projects into categories and its in my best interest to journal them in a md file.
* ex: javascript_project_on_palindromes -> javascript(directory)


##What this repository will do

This will be a great way to demonstrate what you have learned to the world.
This will serve as a portfolio and as something to look forward to.
